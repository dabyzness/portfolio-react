      <p>
        I’m a software developer with a focus in ethical client-minded design,
        believing that tech should minimize the stressors in our lives, not
        magnify them. When it comes to programming, I’m passionate about
        efficiency, readability, documentation, and testing. I thrive under
        pressure and tight-deadlines while maintaining my composure,
        reliability, and dependability. By bringing a forward thinking approach
        to designing solutions, I keep scalability and optimization at the
        forefront of my problem solving.
