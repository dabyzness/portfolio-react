You play as the yellow, gluttonous menace, Pacman, whose only goal is to gobble up all of the snack pellets on the board -- but it's not as easy as it seems. You'll have to avoid a pack of ghosts chasing after you, one wrong move and it's game over. Do you have what it takes to outsmart them and swallow up all the pellets?",

      "This is a spin-off on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. There are three different versions that you can play: Toe, Pro, and No. Toe is the original Tic-Tac-Toe. Pro expands on the original by creating a 3x3 grid of the original 3x3 game, in total creating a 9x9 grid. The square in which the next allowable move may be placed is determined by the the preceding move. Plan accordingly to stumble your opponents next move! And finally, No is just the original game with a twist -- You'll never be able to win!",
